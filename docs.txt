Drawing System:

based on Java awt and swing, which is a gui toolkit based on awt. This is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes. 

The program draws onto the screen using a coordinate system, where top left is (0,0) and bottom right is the maximum window width and height.

the first function of the ShapeDrawing class is *paint()*, which is a special function that is automatically called whenever the window is drawn. 

Graphics g is the drawing "pen." Casting Graphics2D to g (g2) allows more advanced graphics operations, like better shapes, strokes, rotations, etc.


public class Main is also special, as it and its function main() are automatically called as the "starting point" of the program. 

This function main creates the window, sets the window size, makes sure that the program closes when the user clicks "x" and adds an instance of "ShapeDrawing" class to the frame so it knows what to draw.
